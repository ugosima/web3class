LESSON 1: Introduction to Web3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<p>
The internet has come a long way, from static web pages to social media and smart apps. Now, we are entering a new era called Web3, and it‚Äôs changing the internet as we know it. But what exactly is Web3?
Web3 (short for Web 3.0) is the next generation of the internet that aims to decentralize control from big tech companies and give more power, ownership, and privacy back to users. It is built using blockchain technology, cryptography, and decentralized protocols.
</p>

<br>



<p class="quickbox">
     <b class="ideabulb">&#128161;</b>  I‚Äôm sure  ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, ‚Äúcryptography‚Äù, and ‚Äúdecentralized protocols‚Äù sounds even bigger and confusing than ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù , but that‚Äôs exactly why you are here and should stick around for longer. </p>
</p>


<br>
Simply put, Web3 is the ‚Äúdecentralized internet‚Äù. It‚Äôs built using blockchain technology and is designed to give more control to users instead of big companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon. With Web3, users can own their data, manage digital assets like cryptocurrencies, and interact online without needing to trust‚Äîor depend on‚Äîcentral authorities.


<br><br>

<p>
 <h3><b>A Quick History</b></h3> 
To understand Web3, it helps to look at what came before it:

<ul>
    <li>Web1 (1990s‚Äìearly 2000s): The ‚Äúread-only‚Äù internet. You could visit websites, but couldn‚Äôt interact much.
</li>
    <li>Web2 (2000s‚Äìnow): The ‚Äúread-and-write‚Äù internet. Social media, cloud apps, and e-commerce grew. But it also meant companies started collecting and controlling huge amounts of user data.
</li>
    <li>Web3: The ‚Äúread-write-own‚Äù internet. It‚Äôs about user control, decentralization, and digital ownership.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>

<p> 
<h3><b> Key Features of Web3</b></h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Decentralization</b>
        No single company or entity controls the entire network. Instead, it‚Äôs run by many independent nodes (computers) around the world.
    </li>
    

    <li>
        Web3 apps (called dApps) run on peer-to-peer networks like blockchains, not on centralized servers. This means no single company owns or controls the app or its data.

    </li>

    <li>
     <b> Digital Ownership :</b>In Web3, you can own digital items‚Äîlike art, music, or game items‚Äîthrough tools like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). You store them in a crypto wallet, which only you control.
    </li>


    <li>
        <b>Built-in Money System:</b>Web3 uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to send money instantly‚Äîwithout banks, middlemen, or borders.
         [This is the dominant aspect of web3 and have generated significant interest of technological investors and enthusiasts.] 
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Smart Contracts:</b>
        These are self-executing codes on the blockchain that run automatically when conditions are met. For example, a smart contract could release payment only when a job is completed‚Äîno human needed.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Open Source:</b>Most Web3 projects are open source, meaning anyone can see, use, or improve the code. This encourages collaboration and innovation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Interoperability:</b>Web3 apps can work together easily. For example, you can use your crypto wallet to buy an NFT on one platform and then use it in a game on another platform.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Permissionless:</b>Anyone can join and use Web3 without needing permission from a central authority. You don‚Äôt need to create an account or get approved by a company.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transparency:</b>All transactions and data on the blockchain are visible to everyone. This means you can verify what‚Äôs happening without needing to trust a company.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Community Governance:</b>Many Web3 projects are governed by their users through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This means decisions are made collectively, not by a single company.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Privacy and Identity:</b>Web3 uses your crypto wallet as your identity. You control what information to share, and there are no passwords to remember.
    </li>

</ol>
</p>
<br><br>

<p> 
<h3><b> Real-Life Examples</b></h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Crypto wallets like MetaMask let you buy, store, and use cryptocurrencies or NFTs.
    </li>
    <li>Decentralized apps like Uniswap let you swap tokens without a bank or exchange.
</li>
    <li>NFT marketplaces like OpenSea let you create, buy, or sell digital art that you truly own.
</li>
    <li>Decentralized games let you own in-game items and even earn money from playing.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>

<p>     
    <h3><b>Why Should You Care? </b></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
Technological developments is constant and thus every individual is expected to grow along or be left behind.
Web3 protects your privacy and identity, and gives you ownership of your digital life.</li>
        <li>
Offers financial freedom through crypto tools, and investments when properly done.</li>
        <li>
Opens up opportunities to earn, build, and participate in global communities‚Äîno matter where you live; It literally solves the problem of international payments, 
so you can easily pay and access services in another country from wherever you are.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br><br>

<p> 
<h3><b>What Are the Challenges?</b></h3> 

Web3 is still young. Some problems you might face:
<ul>
    <li>It can be confusing at first (wallets, gas fees, keys, etc.)‚Ä¶.This is exactly why we are here.
</li>
    <li>Some DApps are hard to use.
</li>
    <li>Scams and mistakes can be costly
</li>
    <li>Governments are still figuring out how to regulate it.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>

<p> 
   But just like the early days of the internet, Web3 is growing fast, and people who learn early will benefit while helping shape the future; So if you're curious and ready to explore, Welcome once again.

  <h1>What is Blockchain Technology?</h1>
<br>
  <p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> is one of the most revolutionary innovations of the 21st century, powering digital currencies like Bitcoin and transforming industries with its promise of transparency, security, and decentralization; But what exactly is blockchain?</p>

  <p>At its core, a <strong>blockchain</strong> is a digital ledger like a database, that stores information in a secure and tamper-proof way. Unlike traditional databases controlled by a single entity (like a bank or company), blockchain is <em>decentralized</em>, meaning it is shared across many computers or nodes.</p>

  <p>Each entry in this ledger is called a <strong>block</strong>, and these blocks are linked or "chained" together in chronological order‚Äîhence the name <strong>blockchain</strong>.</p>

<br>

  <h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Transaction Occurs:</strong> A user initiates a transaction, such as sending cryptocurrency or recording data.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction is Verified:</strong> A network of computers (called nodes) validates the transaction using algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction is Added to a Block:</strong> Once verified, the transaction is grouped with others into a block.</li>
    <li><strong>Block is Added to the Chain:</strong> The block is attached to the existing blockchain in a permanent, unchangeable way.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once a block is added, the data it contains is nearly impossible to alter without changing every subsequent block‚Äîa feature that makes blockchain highly secure.</p>


  <br>
    
<div class="quickbox">
     <h2 class="qbheading"><b class="ideabulb">&#128161; </b> <b class="qbheading"> Analogy: How Blockchain Works</b> </h2>
    <br>

  <p>Imagine a classroom where every student has a notebook. This notebook is used to record every time someone borrows or returns a book from the class library.</p>

  <h3>üìò Step-by-Step Analogy:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>A Transaction Happens:</strong> John borrows a book titled "Science Today".</li>
    <li><strong>Everyone Sees It:</strong> Instead of one person writing it down, all students copy the same transaction into their notebooks: <br>
      <em>"John borrowed 'Science Today' at 10:00 AM"</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Information is Locked In:</strong> Once all students write it down, that page in the notebook is considered complete and can't be changed.</li>
    <li><strong>The Chain Continues:</strong> The next transaction (e.g., Mary returns "Math Basics") is recorded on a new page, following the previous one.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This way, the class keeps a tamper-proof, shared history of every library transaction. If someone tries to cheat and change their notebook, it won‚Äôt match others‚Äîand everyone will know!</p>

  <h3>üîí How This Relates to Blockchain:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The notebook</strong> represents the blockchain.</li>
    <li><strong>The students</strong> are like the network nodes (computers).</li>
    <li><strong>The recorded entries</strong> are the blocks.</li>
    <li><strong>The linking of pages</strong> is the chain of blocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Consensus among students</strong> ensures no one can fake or alter history.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>In summary:</strong> Just like the classroom notebook system, blockchain creates a shared, secure, and permanent record of transactions‚Äîopen to all, but impossible to alter without agreement from everyone involved.</p>

</div>



<br>
  <h2>Key Features of Blockchain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single authority controls the blockchain. All participants have access to the same information.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Transactions are visible to all participants in the network.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure data is secure and cannot be tampered with.</li>
    <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>Consensus Mechanism:</strong> Decisions are made collectively by the network, usually through methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Blockchain</h2>

  <p>Blockchain is not limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It has a wide range of applications across various sectors:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Enabling peer-to-peer payments, eliminating the need for middlemen, and increasing transaction speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Storing patient records securely and giving patients control over their data.</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> Tracking products from source to destination, ensuring authenticity and quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Creating tamper-proof digital voting systems to improve transparency and trust.</li>
    <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Recording property ownership and transaction history in a secure manner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages of Blockchain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reduces fraud and corruption</li>
    <li>Improves efficiency and speed of transactions</li>
    <li>Lowers operational costs by eliminating intermediaries</li>
    <li>Empowers users with control over their own data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges of Blockchain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Some blockchains are slow and cannot handle a large number of transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Proof of Work systems can use massive amounts of electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Many governments are still deciding how to regulate blockchain technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The technology is still new and difficult for many to understand or implement.</li>
  </ul>







  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Blockchain technology has the potential to transform industries by making systems more secure, transparent, and decentralized. While it comes with its own set of challenges, its advantages are far-reaching. As innovation continues, blockchain is likely to become an even more significant part of our digital future.</p>

  <p><em>Understanding blockchain today means being ready for tomorrow‚Äôs world of technology and finance.</em></p>



  LESSON 3: Introduction to Cryptocurrency


  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  <p>In the digital age, the concepts of <strong>cryptography</strong> and <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> are 
    becoming increasingly important, especially as the world moves toward decentralized systems, blockchain-based 
    platforms, and digital finance. While they are often mentioned together, they are not the same thing; However, they 
    are <em>deeply connected</em>.</p>
<br>

  <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the science of protecting data through mathematical techniques. 
    It's goal is to secure communication and ensure that only intended recipients can understand the message or access the data.</p>
  <br>

  <h3> <u class="b-6"> <b>Core Functions of Cryptography</b> </u></h3>
  Cryptography serves four main functions that are crucial for secure communication and data integrity, these are:
  <br>
  <br>

 <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
    <li><strong>Confidentiality : </strong>  Prevents unauthorized access to information.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity : </strong>  Ensures the information hasn‚Äôt been altered.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication : </strong>  Verifies the identity of users or sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-repudiation : </strong>  Prevents denial of involvement in a transaction.</li>
  </ol>

    <br>
  <h2><u><b>Types of Cryptography</b></u></h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong>: The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.</li>
    <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption</strong>: Uses a public and private key pair.</li>
  </ol>
<br>
  <p>
    <strong>Symmetric encryption</strong> is faster and suitable for large data, while <strong>asymmetric encryption</strong> is more secure and used for key exchange and digital signatures.
     It is important to note that both types of cryptography are essential for the functioning of cryptocurrencies, as they provide the necessary security and trust mechanisms.
    <br>
  </p>
  <br>

    <div class="quickbox">
     <h2 class="qbheading"><b class="ideabulb">&#128161; </b> <b class="qbheading"> NOTEWORTHY</b> </h2>
    <br>
        It is necessary to mention cryptography in the build up of Web3 studies; However, deeper knowledge of cryptography must be 
        sourced through dedicated texts and academic research works which are far beyond the scope of this lesson.
    </div>


  <br><br>
  <h2> <u><b> What is Cryptocurrency? </b></u></h2>
  <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses <strong>cryptography</strong> to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and validate asset transfers.</p>
<br><br>

  <h2><u> <b> Relationship between Cryptography and Cryptocurrency  </b> </u></h2>
  <p>Cryptography is <strong> what makes cryptocurrency possible</strong>. Without cryptography, cryptocurrencies would be easy to 
    counterfeit, vulnerable to fraud, and impossible to verify.
    Therefore, cryptography provides the foundation for the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of cryptocurrencies.</p>  
Cryptography makes cryptocurrencies possible by the implementation of several key concepts and technologies. Here‚Äôs how they work together and the benefits of cryptography:
<br>
  <h2><b> 1. Digital Signatures</b></h2>
  <p>When someone sends cryptocurrency, they must prove ownership of the funds using a <strong>private key</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>digital signature</strong> is created using cryptographic algorithms.</li>
    <li>It is verified by others using the sender‚Äôs <strong>public key</strong>.</li>
   This ensures authenticity without revealing the private key, It's like signing a check, but mathematically, and in a way that can‚Äôt be forged.
  </ul>
  <br>



  <h2> <b> 2. Hash Functions</b></h2>
  <p>A hash function turns input into a fixed-length string. It is one-way and impossible to reverse.</p>
  <p>Even small changes in input create vastly different outputs.</p>
  <h3> Use Cases :</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Transaction IDs</li>
    <li>Block verification</li>
    <li>Proof-of-Work (e.g., mining)</li>
     This special functions are only possible through cryptography.
  </ol>
   



  <br>
  <h2> <b>3. Wallets and Key Pairs </b> </h2>
  <p>A crypto wallet stores your keys, not your money.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Public Key</strong>: Like a bank account number</li>
    <li><strong>Private Key</strong>: Like your ATM PIN</li>

    This special keys  are generated using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that only the owner can access their funds.
  </ol>


  <br>
  <h2><b> 4. Secure Transactions on the Blockchain</b></h2>
  <p>Each crypto transaction is encrypted, signed, and verified using cryptographic functions. No banks are needed; the network itself is the trust layer.</p>
  <br>



  <h2> <b> 5. Consensus Mechanisms Use Cryptography</b> </h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies use consensus to agree on transactions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong> ‚Äì Mining with computational puzzles</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong> ‚Äì Validators hold coins to propose blocks</li>
  </ol>
<br>



  <h2> <b> <u>  Examples of cryptocurrencies, and cryptographic applications </u></b></h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin & Ethereum</strong> ‚Äì Core cryptographic networks</li>
    <li><strong>NFTs</strong> ‚Äì Verified with cryptographic proofs</li>
    <li><strong>zk-SNARKs</strong> ‚Äì Enables private transactions</li>
    <li><strong>Signal & Secure Messaging</strong> ‚Äì Uses cryptographic protocols</li>
  </ol>


  <br>
  <h2> <b> <u>Challenges of Cryptocurrency </u></b> </h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Key Loss :  &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>  Lose your key, lose access</li>
    <li><strong>User Error : &nbsp;</strong> ‚Äì No support to recover lost funds</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability :  &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> ‚Äì Some blockchains are slow and requires enormous resources to scale</li>
    <li><strong>Quantum Threat :  &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> ‚Äì May break current encryption</li>
  </ol>

  <br>

  <h2> <u> <b>  Summary </b></u></h2>
  <p>Cryptography and cryptocurrency are inseparable. One is the <strong>science of security</strong>, and the other is the <strong>application of that science to money</strong>. Together, they enable a new era of digital finance where individuals control their assets.</p>


  LESSON 4: Cryptocurrency as Money


  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  <p>Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies are:
    <ol  class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>Decentralized</li>
      <li>Borderless</li>
      <li>Digital-only</li>
      <li>Stored on a blockchain</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <br>

 <h2> <u><b>Why Is Crypto even accepted as money?</b> </u> </h2> 
    
  <p>Ultimately, <strong>money is a shared belief</strong>; If a high number of people believes that a particular material that has certain properties is a medium of exchange, then that material becomes "Money".</p>
  However, there are basic properties of Money, Cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) is accepted as money because it has these properties, though digital and decentralized. 
  To be accepted as money, an item must have these properties or functions :
<br><br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>1. Medium of exchange</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2"> People must be able to use it to buy goods and services.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>2. Store of Value </b>  </td>
    <td>It must keep its value over time so people can save it.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>3. Unit of Account</b>  </td>
    <td>Prices must be able to be expressed in it .</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>4. Divisibility</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">It must be easily divided into smaller parts.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>5. Portability</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">It must be easy to carry and transfer .</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>6. Durability</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">It must withstand wear and tear.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>7. Fungibility</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">Each unit must be interchangeable (just as a one dollar bill is the same as another).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>10. Acceptability</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">People must generally agree to accept it as payment.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>11. Limited Supply</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">There should be a controlled supply to prevent inflation .</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>12. Security</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">It must be secure against counterfeiting.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>13. Accessibility</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2">It should be easy for people to access and use .</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>

  <p>These functions are why we accept things like gold, silver, or even paper money as "money", because they allow us to trade, save, and measure value. Cryptocurrency meets these functions in many ways, and is largely accepted because:</p>
<br>
  <ol class="space-y-4 list-decimal list-inside"> 

      <li>
      <strong> People trust it's Technology :</strong>

      Crypto is secured by blockchain technology and cryptography; This makes it tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized.
   The world accepts it because the rules are clear, secure, and enforced by code, not banks or governments.
</li>

  <li>

      <strong> It is borderless and fast :</strong>

      With Crypto,

      <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">
        <li>People can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Transactions are fast and often cost less than traditional methods.</li>
        <li>You don‚Äôt need a bank or even government permission.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      This makes it very useful for international trade, remittances, and online payments, and is especially useful in countries with unstable currencies and/or limited banking access.

  </li>


  <li>     
       <strong>Limited Supply : </strong>
      Bitcoin for example, has a maximum supply of 21 million coins; Scarcity makes it similar to gold, which people trust to hold value over time.
  </li>


  <li>
      <strong>People Control Their Money : </strong>

      Cryptocurrency gives users ownership and control over their funds without needing banks or governments. This means:
        
      <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">


      <li>No one can freeze your account.</li>

      <li>No one can stop your transaction.</li>
      <li>No inflation from central banks printing more.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      This financial freedom is very appealing to many people, especially in places with corrupt or unstable governments.
</li>

</ol>
<br>

  <h3> <u><b> How did people come to believe that Cryptocurrency Is money? </b></u>   </h3>
  <br>

  <p>People came to believe that <strong>cryptocurrency is money</strong> over time due to a combination of economic behavior, utility, technological expansion,  and social consensus; 
    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began fulfilling the roles traditional money played because people used them to buy goods, saved them as investments, and even priced items. 
    people trusted cryptocurrencies because they are built on <strong>blockchain technology</strong>, which is secure, transparent, and decentralized. This means that their investments were safe and hassle free. In regions with unstable banks or hyperinflation, crypto became a safe alternative.</p>
  As more people and institutions began to buy, use, and accept crypto, a belief formed: <em> "If others treat it like money, maybe I should too." </em> This social proof helped drive adoption, and now for many, crypto is not just digital money, it is now a strong movement and a generally important aspect of finance and technology.</p>

  <br>
  

  <h3> <u> <b>Some popular Cryptocurrencies include: </b></u>   </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
    <li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
    <li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
    <li>Solana (SOL)</li>
  </ul>



  LESSON 5: Beginner Terminologies in cryptocurrency.



  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  <p>Cryptocurrency can seem like a foreign language when you're just starting out. From blockchains and wallets to gas fees and HODL, the crypto world is full of unique terms of which understanding them  is essential for anyone looking to get involved with cryptocurrency, whether as a user, investor, developer, or enthusiast.</p>

  <p>Let's look at some of the most common and important terminologies in cryptocurrency,all explained in simple terms.</p>

  <h2> <b> 1. Blockchain/Network </b> </h2>
  <p>A blockchain is a digital ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each group of transactions forms a "block," and these blocks are linked together in a chain. It is the foundational technology behind cryptocurrencies, every blockchain has it's coin.</p>
<br>

  <h2> <b> 2. Coin or Token </b> </h2>
  <p>A Coin or Token is any digital form of money that is decentralized and built on blockchain technology. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coins are made specifically for the blockchain, while Tokens are crypto built on an already existing blockchain. </p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong>Though they are not the same, Token/Coin are used interchangeably to mean the same thing in practise.</p>
<br>

  <h2> <b>3. Wallet</b></h2>
  <p>A wallet is a software or hardware tool used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies, it is similar to a bank account. It contains your public and private keys, and your wallet address all generated from your seed phrase.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hot Wallet:</strong> Connected to the internet, e.g. Metamask, Trustwallet, Phantom e.t.c.</li>
    <li><strong>Cold Wallet:</strong> Offline, more secure e.g., hardware wallets like Ledger, they are usually specialized devices for crypto transactions.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>

  
  <h2><b>4. Seed phrase / Recovery Phrase</b></h2>
  <p>This is the 12 or 24 words phrase that gives access to a wallets private key, everybody that has this words in the right order will access the funds in the wallet, so it is meant to be protected and must not be revealed to 2nd party;
     it is recommended that they are handwritten on paper and filed up safely, losing them also means losing access to your account. </p>
<br>

  
  <h2><b>5. Private Key / Public Key</b></h2>
  <p>Private and public keys are unique cryptographic keys used in blockchain transactions, they are generated from seed phrases and are uniquely bound to a particular seed phrase. They are essential for securing your wallet and authorizing transactions.</p>
  <p>Never share your private key with anyone, as it gives full control over your wallet and funds. If someone has your private key, they can access and transfer your cryptocurrency without your permission.</p>
  <p>Simply put : </p>
  <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">
    <li><strong>Public Key: </strong> Shared openly, and can be used at the backend of dapps to generate your wallet address.</li>
    <li><strong>Private Key: </strong> Kept secret and used to authorize transactions. Losing or exposing this means losing the sole access and ownership to your funds.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Note : </strong>A public key is not a wallet address, it is a longer string of characters that is used to generate the wallet address; do not transfer funds to a public key.</p>
  <br>

  <h2><b> 6. Wallet Address </b></h2>
    <p>A crypto address is a unique string of characters used to send or receive cryptocurrency, similar to a bank account number.</p>
      <p>It is derived from your public key and can be shared with others to receive funds; Always double-check the address before sending crypto, as transactions are irreversible, to prevent mistakes, always copy and paste addresses, do not type them.</p>
  <p><strong> Example : </strong> A Bitcoin address looks like this: <code> <b>1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa</b></code></p>
  <p><strong>Note : </strong> Always ensure you are using the correct address format for the specific cryptocurrency you are dealing with, as different coins have different address formats; you will develop this knowledge with time.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>7. Gas Fee </b></h2>
  <p>A gas fee is a small payment required to perform a transaction or execute a smart contract on a blockchain. It pays the network validators for processing.</p>
<br>

  <h2> <b>8. Gas Limit </b></h2>
  <p>The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction. If the transaction requires more gas than the limit, it will fail.</p>
<br>

 <h2><strong>9. DApp (Decentralized Application)</strong></h2>
  <p>A DApp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, typically using smart contracts. DApps are open-source, operate autonomously, and are not controlled by a single entity.</p>  
  <br>

  <h2><b>10. Faucet</b></h2>
  <p>A faucet is a website or app that gives out small amounts of cryptocurrency for free, usually to help users learn how to use wallets and transactions. It is often used to distribute testnet coins for developers and testers.</p>
<br>

  <h2> <b>11. Testnet </b></h2>
  <p>A testnet is a separate blockchain used for testing purposes. It allows developers to experiment with new features without risking real money. Testnets use test coins that have no real value.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>12. Exchange </b></h2>
  <p>A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where you can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. They are grouped into :</p>
   <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">
    <li><strong>Centralized Exchange (CEX):</strong> Operated by a company, requires registration, and holds user funds; e.g Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io,MEXC, e.t.c</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Exchange (DEX):</strong> Peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries, users retain control of their funds; e.g Jupiter, Uniswap, Pancakeswap, e.t.c </li> 
    <li><strong>Hybrid Exchange:</strong> Combines features of both CEX and DEX, offering a balance of security and usability; e.g. Kado, dYdX, e.t.c</li>
  </ol>
<br>

 <h2><b>13. Altcoin </b></h2>

<br>

   <h2><b>15. Token Symbol & Decimals </b></h2>
  <p>
        Every cryptocurrency has a ticker used to identify the token e.g, Bitcoin's ticker is BTC, Ethereum is ETH, and Solana is SOL.
</p>
<br>

   <h2><b>16. Tokenomics</b></h2>
    <p>Short for "Token Economics", refers to the economic model behind a token i.e how it is created, distributed, used, and maintained to give it value.</p>
<br>

 <p>The Maximum number of a token that will ever created.</p>
 <br>


 <h2><strong>18. Circulating Supply </strong></h2>
 <p>The total number of Tokens currently in public circulation.</p>
 <br>

 <h2><strong>19. Initial Supply</strong></h2>
 <p>The Total number of the Tokens released at launch.</p>
 <br>

  <h2><strong>20. Market Cap </strong></h2>
  <p>Market capitalization is calculated as price of a coin multiplied by the total number of coins in circulation. It is used to measure the size and popularity of a cryptocurrency.</p>
  <br>

 <h2><strong>21. Burning</strong></h2>
 <p>This is the act of permanently removing tokens to reduce supply, it is done by sending tokens to a non-existent or non-accessible address; burning creates scarcity, thereby increasing the value of a crypto token.</p>
 <br>

  <h2><b>22. Emission Rate </b></h2>
  <p>Emission rate is a term used to describe the rate at which new tokens are created and introduced into circulation,  It may be per block, per day, or per year; It is an important aspect of tokenomics, influencing supply and demand dynamics.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>23. Mining </b></h2>
  <p>Mining is the process of verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. It is mostly used in Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin. Miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency for their work.</p>
  <br>


  <h2><b>24. Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> A consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network. It requires significant computational power and energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. It is more energy-efficient than PoW.</li> 
<br>

  <h2><b>25. Staking</b></h2>
  <p>Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. It is used in Proof of Stake systems, and stakers are rewarded with additional coins.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>26. Volatility</b></h2>
  <p>Volatility refers to how much and how quickly the price of a cryptocurrency changes. Crypto is known for being highly volatile.</p>
<br>
  
  <h2><b>27. FUD</b></h2>

<br>

  <h2><b>28. HODL</b></h2>
  <p>Originally a typo of "hold", HODL means "Hold On for Dear Life". It encourages crypto holders to keep their coins long-term despite market drops.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>29. Pump and Dump</b></h2>
  <p>A scheme where the price of a cryptocurrency is artificially inflated (pumped) and then quickly sold off (dumped) for profit. This often affects small or low-volume coins.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>30. Bear Market / Bull Market </b></h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Bull Market:</strong> Prices are rising, and optimism is high.</li>
    <li><strong>Bear Market:</strong> Prices are falling, and pessimism dominates.</li>
  </ol>
<br>

  <h2><b>31. NFT (Non-Fungible Token)</b></h2>
  <p>A type of digital asset that represents ownership of unique items like art, music, or game collectibles. NFTs are mostly built on Ethereum.</p>
<br>

  <h2><b>32. Airdrops</b></h2>
  <p>An airdrop is a method of rewarding the holders or participants of a specific cryptocurrency with that crypto token.
     It is often used to promote new projects or reward loyal users.</p>
     <p>Airdrops are used to raise awareness about a new project or to incentivize users to engage with a platform.</p>
  <p>To receive an airdrop, you usually need to hold a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency in your wallet at a given time, or you may need to complete certain tasks like following social media accounts, joining a community, or helping in the development of the project.</p>
  <p>Note: Always be cautious of airdrops, as some may be scams or require you to share sensitive information. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for your private key or seed phrase.</p>
<br>

  <h2> <strong>33. ICO / IDO</strong></h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>ICO:</strong> Initial Coin Offering ‚Äî a fundraising method where a new cryptocurrency is sold to early investors.</li>
