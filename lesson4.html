 <h2> <u><b>Why Is Crypto even accepted as money?</b> </u> </h2> 
    
  <p>Ultimately, <strong>money is a shared belief</strong>; If a high number of people believes that a particular material that has certain properties is a medium of exchange, then that material becomes "Money".</p>
  However, there are basic properties of Money, Cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) is accepted as money because it has these properties, though digital and decentralized. 
  To be accepted as money, an item must have these properties or functions :
<br><br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>1. Medium of exchange</b>  </td>
    <td class="indent-2"> People must be able to use it to buy goods and services.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> <b>2. Store of Value </b>  </td>
    <td>It must keep its value over time so people can save it.</td>

  <p>These functions are why we accept things like gold, silver, or even paper money as "money", because they allow us to trade, save, and measure value. Cryptocurrency meets these functions in many ways, and is largely accepted because:</p>
<br>
  <ol class="space-y-4 list-decimal list-inside"> 

      <li>
      <strong> People trust it's Technology :</strong>

      Crypto is secured by blockchain technology and cryptography; This makes it tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized.
   The world accepts it because the rules are clear, secure, and enforced by code, not banks or governments.
</li>

  <li>

      <strong> It is borderless and fast :</strong>

      With Crypto,

      <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">
        <li>People can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Transactions are fast and often cost less than traditional methods.</li>
        <li>You donâ€™t need a bank or even government permission.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      This makes it very useful for international trade, remittances, and online payments, and is especially useful in countries with unstable currencies and/or limited banking access.

  </li>


  <li>     
       <strong>Limited Supply : </strong>
      Bitcoin for example, has a maximum supply of 21 million coins; Scarcity makes it similar to gold, which people trust to hold value over time.
  </li>


  <li>
      <strong>People Control Their Money : </strong>

      Cryptocurrency gives users ownership and control over their funds without needing banks or governments. This means:
        
      <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside  indent-4">


      <li>No one can freeze your account.</li>

      <li>No one can stop your transaction.</li>
      <li>No inflation from central banks printing more.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      This financial freedom is very appealing to many people, especially in places with corrupt or unstable governments.

</ol>

  <h3> <u><b> How did people come to believe that Cryptocurrency Is money? </b></u>   </h3>
  <br>

  <p>People came to believe that <strong>cryptocurrency is money</strong> over time due to a combination of economic behavior, utility, technological expansion,  and social consensus; 
    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began fulfilling the roles traditional money played because people used them to buy goods, saved them as investments, and even priced items. 
    people trusted cryptocurrencies because they are built on <strong>blockchain technology</strong>, which is secure, transparent, and decentralized. This means that their investments were safe and hassle free. In regions with unstable banks or hyperinflation, crypto became a safe alternative.</p>
  As more people and institutions began to buy, use, and accept crypto, a belief formed: <em> "If others treat it like money, maybe I should too." </em> This social proof helped drive adoption, and now for many, crypto is not just digital money, it is now a strong movement and a generally important aspect of finance and technology.</p>
