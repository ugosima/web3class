  <p>In the digital age, the concepts of <strong>cryptography</strong> and <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> are 
    becoming increasingly important, especially as the world moves toward decentralized systems, blockchain-based 
    platforms, and digital finance. While they are often mentioned together, they are not the same thing; However, they 
    are <em>deeply connected</em>.</p>
<br>

  <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the science of protecting data through mathematical techniques. 
    It's goal is to secure communication and ensure that only intended recipients can understand the message or access the data.</p>
  <br><br>


  <h3>Core Functions of Cryptography:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> â€“ Prevents unauthorized access to information.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity</strong> â€“ Ensures the information hasnâ€™t been altered.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication</strong> â€“ Verifies the identity of users or sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-repudiation</strong> â€“ Prevents denial of involvement in a transaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Types of Cryptography:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong>: The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.</li>
    <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption</strong>: Uses a public and private key pair.</li>
  </ul>


  <br><br>
  <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
  <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses <strong>cryptography</strong> to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and validate asset transfers.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”— How Are Cryptography and Cryptocurrency Related?</h2>
  <p>Cryptography is <strong>what makes cryptocurrency possible</strong>. Without cryptography, cryptocurrencies would be easy to counterfeit, vulnerable to fraud, and impossible to verify.</p>
<br><br>
  <h2>ðŸ§  1. Digital Signatures</h2>
  <p>When someone sends cryptocurrency, they must prove ownership of the funds using a <strong>private key</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>digital signature</strong> is created using cryptographic algorithms.</li>
    <li>It is verified by others using the senderâ€™s <strong>public key</strong>.</li>
    <li>This ensures authenticity without revealing the private key.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Real-world Comparison:</em> It's like signing a checkâ€”but mathematically, and in a way that canâ€™t be forged.</p>


  <br><br>
  <h2> 2. Hash Functions</h2>
  <p>A hash function turns input into a fixed-length string. It is one-way and impossible to reverse.</p>
  <p>Even small changes in input create vastly different outputs.</p>

  <h3> Use Cases:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transaction IDs</li>
    <li>Block verification</li>
    <li>Proof-of-Work (e.g., mining)</li>
  </ul>


  <br><br>
  <h2>3. Wallets and Key Pairs</h2>
  <p>A crypto wallet stores your keys, not your money.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Public Key</strong>: Like a bank account number</li>
    <li><strong>Private Key</strong>: Like your ATM PIN</li>
  </ul>


  <br><br>
  <h2>4. Secure Transactions on the Blockchain</h2>
  <p>Each crypto transaction is encrypted, signed, and verified. No banks are needed; the network itself is the trust layer.</p>
<br><br>



  <h2>5. Consensus Mechanisms Use Cryptography</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies use consensus to agree on transactions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong> â€“ Mining with computational puzzles</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong> â€“ Validators hold coins to propose blocks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cryptography and cryptocurrency are inseparable. One is the <strong>science of security</strong>, and the other is the <strong>application of that science to money</strong>. Together, they enable a new era of digital finance where individualsâ€”not banksâ€”control their assets.</p>

  <p>Understanding both is essential in the 21st century, not just for tech professionals, but for anyone who wants to navigate the future of money, privacy, and trust online.</p>
